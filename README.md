## Description

This is a version of the Frogger classic arcade game coded by me as part of the [**Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree**](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). This game allows you to select your preferred player sprite from five options. The game is timed: each game episode is **two** minutes. Additionally, your high score is stored in your browser across game sessions even after closing and restarting your browser .

## How to Play

It's pretty simple. 

* First select your preferred player sprite on the welcome screen by clicking on your choice. 
* Immediately after your selection, the timer begins a countdown of two minutes. 
* Each game begins with the player having **five** lives and **zero** points. 
* All you need to do is avoid the enemy bugs while making your way to the water at the top of the screen. 
* Each time you successfully make it to the water, you gain 10 points. While each time, you run into an enemy you lose five points and one live. 
* You navigate the game using the four keyboard arrow keys (up, right, down, and left). These are the only allowed keys.
* The game ends either when you run out of time or lives. 
* You can start a new game episode by clicking refresh in the browser tab where your game is running.
